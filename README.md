## Description
We are tackling the problem statement of "Integrating with a smart environment". We primarily want to tackle the issue of tackling emergencies through early intervention and dectection measures and thereby increasing the optimisation of emergency resources. The idea we are proposing consist of a command centre system that acts as a notification and alert centre which takes in information from various sensors and IoT devices around the island to alert of any emergencies. Data could also come from peer-to-peer sharing via SCDF apps such as myResponder. All the raw data from the sensors would then be analyse and a alert will be generated on the dashboard if an emergency has been detected. The command centre can then go through each emergency and obtain live information from the various centre throughout the emergency response duration. The command centre could go through a live walk through with the CFRs on how to tackle the emergency based on all the data obtained from all the sensors, IoT as well as the CFR via the mission screen.
