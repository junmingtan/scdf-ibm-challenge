## Description
We are tackling the problem statement of "Integrating with a smart environment". We primarily want to tackle the issue of tackling emergencies through early intervention and dectection measures and thereby increasing the optimisation of emergency resources. The idea we are proposing consist of a command centre system that acts as a notification and alert centre which takes in information from various sensors and IoT devices around the island to alert of any emergencies. Data could also come from peer-to-peer sharing via SCDF apps such as myResponder. All the raw data from the sensors would then be analyse and a alert will be generated on the dashboard if an emergency has been detected. The command centre can then go through each emergency and obtain live information from the various centre throughout the emergency response duration. The command centre could go through a live walk through with the CFRs on how to tackle the emergency based on all the data obtained from all the sensors, IoT as well as the CFR via the mission screen.

## Detailed Solution
i actually think the idea would work and can fit into IBM cloud - so we scrap instagram / their own app for videos on scene and put it into our stage 4. then stage 3 will be a GPS location of all the myResponders people . then early prevention we just pitch the ioT device broadcast to the command centre into the start screen. so its the same stages we went through but we update stage 3 and stage 4 to integrate. then the cloud functions will be to scrap the stage 4 when triggered and to put the script for stage 3. then maybe stage 1 and 2 can be compressed or deleted. So in the sense the command centre will be the early prevention + tracking other responders to help. then can also add the idea of the myResponders will get live help thing
